                While it is important to share your fundamental beliefs with others, this aspect of
                of who I am is a little more personal as it goes into the very core of who I am.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I have a small family that is slowly getting larger. I often feel that I am unable
                to keep up with the demands of my family monitarily and emotionally. All the while 
                I can feel myself slipping into this dark and lonely place between blind fury and
                overwhelming grief for who I was. Yet in that place, I was able to find an answer.

                Coding, web design, software engineering. These things are abhorrently boring or dull
                to some and mind numbingly tedious to others. However, to me this is the one time
                where I have full control over my life. The computer is like my small children who know
                nothing of the world around them and must be guided with great care less a problem is 
                to occur. The problems are simple, the design is always towards a solution, and the 
                solution, if input correctly, will always work. If it doesn't, then the fault lies
                entirely with me and not some phantom force within the world. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                While to others it may be difficult or uninteresting, to me it is one of the few things
                that makes all the sense in the world.
