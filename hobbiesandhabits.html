        A Few of the Things I Like to Do
    </h1>

        <p class="paragraph">
            A few of the things that I like to do include sharpening my mind and increasing
            my ability to identify and manipulate objects or ideas within the confines of the 
            object within itself by performing actions such as the following:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Design a puzzle or riddle</li>
                <li>Develop a minigame in Unreal Engine</li>
                <li>Research and contemplate an idea or theory that is new to me</li>
                <li>Inquire into a sensitive social topic with someone whom I fundamentally disagree with</li>
            </ol>

        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            By performing these actions I am able to attain new understandings of things that I
            commonly believe that I am knowledgeable about. It also allows me to reassess my 
            current beliefs in order to make changes if necessary or temper my resolve in my belief.
